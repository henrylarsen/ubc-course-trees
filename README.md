# Course Pre-requisite Tree

## Description

The Course Pre-requisite Tree project is a tool designed to help users explore and plan their academic journey at the 
University of British Columbia (UBC). By utilizing a visual pre-requisite tree for a selected course, students can gain 
a better understanding of the required dependencies for their desired courses.

## Current Work

- **Scraping Data**: The current focus of this project involves scraping data from thousands of UBC courses 
([https://courses.students.ubc.ca](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-all-departments))
. The 
collected information will be stored in JSON files, allowing us to efficiently access and manage the prerequisite data.

## Next Steps

- **Arbitrary-Arity Trees**: The next step in the project is to implement arbitrary-arity trees in C++. These trees will
 be used to represent the complex dependencies between courses, providing a more accurate and flexible representation of
  course prerequisites.

## Final Goal

- **Front-End Development**: The ultimate goal of this project is to build a user-friendly front-end interface. With 
this interface, users can easily search for courses, explore course dependencies, and plan their academic path at UBC. 
This front-end will provide a seamless experience for students to navigate through the course pre-requisite tree, 
making course planning a more efficient and transparent process.
